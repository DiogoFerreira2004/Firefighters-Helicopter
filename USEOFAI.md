We have integrated AI assistance in several aspects of the project to enhance development efficiency and creativity:

- Debugging: AI was used to identify and resolve issues in our code more efficiently. It helped trace logic errors, resolve unexpected behavior, and improve overall program stability by providing targeted solutions and suggestions.
- Shaders Creation: It assisted in developing complex visual effects
- Helicopter Development: AI contributed to the implementation of visual and functional elements related to the helicopter, since it uses physics calculations and is a combination of various complex elements.
